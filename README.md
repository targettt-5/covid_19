## 📊 Data Sources
COVID-19 Data
Global and regional cases, deaths, and recoveries

Daily, weekly, and monthly trends

Population and demographic metrics

Air Quality Data
AQI metrics: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.

Data for Indian metropolitan cities (Delhi, Mumbai, etc.)

Temporal comparisons before, during, and after lockdowns

## 📈 Visualizations
1. Global Analysis
Interactive world map showing pandemic spread

Timeline of global infection rates

Country-wise comparisons of key metrics

Summary widgets for key statistics and trends

2. India & Air Quality Analysis
City-wise dashboards for major Indian metropolitan areas

Correlation charts for AQI vs. COVID-19 cases

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations
Data is based on historical datasets and may not reflect real-time updates

The application requires a modern browser with JavaScript enabled

Performance may be impacted when rendering very large datasets

Some charts depend on external libraries and require an internet connection

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
Integrate live data APIs for real-time updates

Incorporate economic and healthcare indicators for a more holistic analysis

Implement machine learning models for forecasting and prediction

Expand coverage to include more cities and additional pollution metrics
